# HLTV-CLI

## Outline

This was mainly a project to work on for myself. The main aim was to work with python and API's a bit more to understand the process.

I also wanted to learn how to output data in different ways as well.

## What it does

The program can be run from a CLI, with python installed, and it will pull in stats from HLTV for the following things:

- Top 5 Teams
- Top 30 Teams
- Top 10 Players
- Last 10 Matches

I'm hoping to make some more specific searches, such as 'teams last 10 matches' or a 'specific players stats' etc.

## Packages & API used

I found an API for HLTC that had been created by SocksPls, big shout out to him for the work! [Link to repo](https://github.com/SocksPls/hltv-api). This is what pulls in the data that in in the output.

I also used the following Python packages:

- ��beautifulsoup4==4.5.1
- bs4==0.0.1
- lxml==3.6.4
- python-utils==2.0.0
- requests==2.20.0
- six==1.10.0
